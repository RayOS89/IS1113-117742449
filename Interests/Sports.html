                    The UFC 
The fastest growing sports organization in the world, the Ultimate Fighting Championship® (UFC®), started in 1993 as a professional mixed martial arts (MMA) organization. 
UFC has revolutionized the fight business, and today stands as the world's leading MMA promoter, offering the premier series of MMA sports events that have sold out some of the biggest arenas and stadiums across the globe.
The UFC organization follows a rich history and tradition of competitive MMA dating back to the Olympic Games in Athens. About 80 years ago, a Brazilian form of MMA known as Vale Tudo (anything goes) sparked local interest in the sport. 
Today, the UFC has evolved into an organization where hybrid athletes are required to know various disciplines in order to compete at an elite level in a regulated environment where safety is paramount. 
UFC athletes are skilled in many forms of martial arts, including karate, jiu-jitsu, boxing, kickboxing, grappling, wrestling, sumo and other combat sports. 
Currently the ranked amoung the highest in the UFC is the Irish mixed martial artist Conor McGregor whom has helped promote and elavate the sport to new heights and a wider audience.

                The meaning of the crowns is not certain but it is thought that they may represent three of the medieval Lordships in Munster, the O’Briens (Thomond), the Butlers (Ormond) and the Fitzgeralds (Desmond).
