                   <p>Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. 
                      Salesforce delivers centrally hosted applications over the Internet as a service. SaaS applications are sometimes called web based software, on demand software, or hosted software. 
                      Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS providers servers.
Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance.
SaaS business applications are usually accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.

                        Amazon Web Services (AWS), by allowing users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications. EC2 encourages scalable deployment of applications by providing a web service through which a user can boot an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to configure a virtual machine, which Amazon calls an "instance", containing any software desired. 
                        A user can create, launch, and terminate server-instances as needed.
